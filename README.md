# NoLimit Indonesia Portfolio
This is my portfolio of some of my work as a social media data analyst at NoLimit Indonesia. During my 3 months internship program, I collect data by searching for client's social media account, hashtag, and keyword related from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, and Tiktok. The output file of this data collection is called an "Object Assessment". Furthermore, I also collect client's competitor on the Object Assessment to compare the social media performance between them. The data is then collected to NoLimit's Dashboard, to be visualized and presented to a report. The report mainly focused on analyzing top post made, top issue discussed by netizens, and impression by netizen's sentiment. In some case, client may have some request to analyze their specific product, that could have more depth in analyzing client's branding. All the analysis is then summarized by giving insights and recommendations to improve client's social media performance and sentiment. In this repository, I would like to publish some of my work to potray the analysis about some clients I have dealt with.
